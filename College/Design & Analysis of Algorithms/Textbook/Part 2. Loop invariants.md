**Initialization**. It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
**Maintenance**. If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
**Termination**. The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant--usually along with the reason that the loop terminated--gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
