## 1.1 Algorithms 
**Problem 1**. Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.
**Solution**. One sorting problem is when you want to find the highest scoring run on the gameplays you have done because it requires comparation between each run with another until a specific run is always higher than the other runs. Shortest distance problem is probably online taxi's maps, it shows the shortest legal path so it can determine the fare needed.

**Problem 2**. Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might you need to consider in a real-world setting?
