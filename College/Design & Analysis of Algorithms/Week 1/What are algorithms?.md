[[Design & Analysis of Algorithms]]

---

Algorithms describe a specific computational procedure for achieving an input-output relationship. They already exist even before the existence of computers. Algorithms lie at the heart of computing.

In other words, they are:
- Any well-defined computational procedure
- A tool for solving a well-specified computational problem
- It takes a value as an input and procedure some value as output

What?
- **Input**: an algorithm has input
